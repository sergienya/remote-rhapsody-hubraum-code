## Why are we here?
### Track all your activities!
An easy tool to track all your daily activities and routines by simply dropping a word to your Magenta. 

Just say 'Starte die Arbeit'/'Starte die Pause' to start tracking, 'Ich bin fertig' to stop tracking, and 'Zeige Statistiken' to show the statistics.

### Advantages
* Healthy balanced lifestyle
* Quality time with your friends, family and favorite projects!
* Increase in productivity :chart_with_upwards_trend:

### Disadvantages

## Sample usage

### Start tracking 
Several modes are supported:
* Work mode with ***Starte die Arbeit***
* Rest mode with ***Starte die Pause***
* Work on specific project with ***Starte {Your Project Name}***

### Stop tracking
The tracking is stopped automatically once you start another tracker. But you can also stop the tracker saying ***Ich bin fertig***. 

### Show statistics
How was the day? Ask you Magenta ***Zeige Statistiken***!
